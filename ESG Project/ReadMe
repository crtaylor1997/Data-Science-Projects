This project contains Data Analysis and Visualization that attempts to quantify the affect that affordable housing development has on low income neighborhoods.
I used data from the U.S. Census and from the Raj Chetty Opportunity index, as well to calculate summary statistics and create interactive maps and visualizations
with python and JavaScript. Click on each file to see the code and look and the output photos for examples of the finished products
